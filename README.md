# Campus-Bot
Made A Bot who controls my account activity in my University's site.

They told us that we must maintain our acitivity in the site everyday. But I was too lazy to log in to that every day and walk through it. And hell they even don't save my sessions. I would have to press that login button every damn time. 
So I thought that nothing bad would happen if I made a software who does this for me.
That's how I started this project.
I used Python, HTML and a bit of CSS along with Selenium automated testing framework and PyQt5 python graphic library.
Almost all of the automation done by using Selenium Webdriver.
The GUI was made using PyQt5.
The code might not be perfect because I am no expert at this.
Also this might not be useful unless you are a Computer Science student of UCSC in Sri Lanka in year 2021.

If you are a my batch mate feel free to use this, using your username and password as relavent details.
